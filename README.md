# Fantasy Frenzy Standings
Pulled several APIs using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to gather the points, username, and league name of the championship teams for the Fantasy Frenzy Tournament.

The code is within the master branch of the repo. 

I pulled several external APIs from the Sleeper Fantasy Football website in order to gather the points, username, and leaguename data from 152 different leagues within the Sleeper system. The data is sorted in decending order of points to get the standings of teh Fantasy Frenzy Tournament. I did this so that each fantasy football competitor could see where their team stands for the final week. Otherwise, it would be impossible for each compeititor to see where they stand compared to the other 151 leagues. In total there are 304 teams. 

Once the data was pulled and sorted I wrote some CSS to style and make the standings look more appealing to the user. The CSS was input directly into my WordPress website. If you are inputing the CSS into a scratch web browser it will look a bit different compared to mine.
